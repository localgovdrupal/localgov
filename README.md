**The publishing platform created by councils, for councils.** LocalGov Drupal is a publicly owned asset that delivers a better digital experience for citizens, improves service outcomes, and saves money.

The [LocalGov Drupal website](https://localgovdrupal.org/) website contains more information about the project, and how your council can get involved!
